# CSS Advanced — ALX Front-End Project
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform the basic HTML layout into a visually appealing webpage using **css**, following the official Figma design precisely.

I will:
- Use an existing HTML structure (from the HTML Advanced task)
- Apply CSS styling to match the Figma mockup
- Download and embed custom fonts
- Add and use the provided image assets
- Ensure proper layout, spacing, alignment, and typography
- Make updates or small fixes to the HTML whenever necessary (e.g., adding image tags, adding classes, fixing missing content)
