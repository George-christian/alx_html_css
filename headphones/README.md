Responsive Web Page — HTML/CSS From Scratch

This project is a fully hand-coded responsive web page built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, Responsive Design techniques, and Accessibility best practices.
No external frameworks. No UI libraries.
Just pure, clean, semantic code.

The goal of this project is to faithfully recreate the layout and interactions of the provided designer file while ensuring high-quality structure, accessibility, and responsiveness.

Project Overview

This web page replicates the exact look and feel of the original design while ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
The implementation focuses on:

Semantic and accessible HTML structure

Clean, maintainable CSS

Responsiveness down to 480px and below

Consistent interaction behaviors (hover, active, focus states)

Content centered with a max width of 1000px

No CSS frameworks, no JS frameworks — only handcrafted code.

📱 Responsive Behavior

The layout adapts automatically based on screen size:

Screen Size	Behavior
Above 480px (Desktop/Tablet)	Displays the full desktop layout
480px and below (Mobile)	Automatically switches to the mobile version of the design

This ensures the page looks pixel-perfect on laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Accessibility Notes

The page follows accessibility best practices:

Semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, footer, etc.)

Descriptive alt text for images

Sufficient color contrast

Keyboard-accessible interactions

Logical heading structure

ARIA labels when necessary.
